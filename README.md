# RegexMatcher-Python
The RegexMatcher-Python script is a lightweight Python tool that leverages the re module to identify occurrences of a specific pattern in a given text.
The defined pattern, [A-Z]ector, targets words ending with "ector" where the first letter is an uppercase alphabet. 
This script serves as a practical example of using regular expressions for pattern matching in Python.
It's suitable for anyone seeking a quick and easy way to find and extract specific patterns within textual data.
